# HostBridge - Commands to Try

This document provides sample requests you can give to an LLM that has access to the HostBridge tool server. These commands demonstrate the capabilities of each tool currently available.

## Admin Dashboard

Before trying commands, you can monitor and approve operations through the admin dashboard:

**Access:** http://localhost:8080/admin/  
**Default Password:** `admin`

The dashboard provides a unified widget-based interface:
- **HITL Approval Queue Widget:** See pending requests, approve/reject directly from dashboard
- **System Health Widget:** Monitor uptime, error rates, and system metrics in real-time
- **Recent Activity Widget:** View last 5 tool executions with status badges

**Features:**
- Expandable/collapsible widgets for flexible monitoring
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (no refresh needed)
- Quick actions directly from dashboard
- "View All" buttons to navigate to dedicated pages for detailed analysis
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Automatic redirect to `/admin/login` when session expires (401 handling)

## Protocol Support

HostBridge supports two protocols:
- **OpenAPI (REST)**: Traditional HTTP REST API
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Modern protocol for AI tool integration using Streamable HTTP

Both protocols expose the same tools from a single source of truth - no code duplication.

## Getting Started

Before trying file operations, it's helpful to understand the workspace configuration:

### Workspace Information

**"What workspace am I working in?"**
- Gets the default workspace directory, available paths, disk usage, and tool categories

**"Show me the workspace configuration"**
- Returns workspace boundaries and available tool categories

**"What secrets are loaded?"**
- Lists the names of secrets available for use in `{{secret:KEY}}` templates (no values exposed)

**"Reload the secrets file"**
- Triggers the server to re-read `secrets.env` from disk (admin action)

### Documentation and Configuration Workflows

**"Read docs/TOOL_CATALOG.md and show me all Docker-related tools"**
- Uses the generated catalog as a quick reference for endpoint and MCP names

**"Generate a fresh tool catalog from the running OpenAPI schema"**
- Runs: `python3 scripts/generate_tool_docs.py > docs/TOOL_CATALOG.md`

**"Compare examples/config.basic.yaml and examples/config.restricted.yaml"**
- Highlights policy and HTTP boundary differences between baseline and hardened setups

**"Show me how to publish this image using docs/DOCKER_HUB_PUBLISHING.md"**
- Walks through build, tag, and push commands for Docker Hub

## Filesystem Tools

## Secrets and HTTP Tools

### Secret Templates

HostBridge resolves `{{secret:KEY}}` placeholders server-side in any tool parameter before execution. The original template (not the resolved value) is stored in audit logs.

**"What secrets are available to use?"**
- Returns the list of loaded secret key names without exposing their values

### HTTP Requests

**"Fetch the contents of https://httpbin.org/get"**
- Makes a simple GET request and returns the response body

**"POST to https://api.example.com/data with JSON body {\"key\": \"value\"}"**
- Makes a POST request with a JSON payload

**"Fetch https://httpbin.org/headers and show me what headers were sent"**
- Inspects the outgoing request headers

**"Make a request to https://slow-api.example.com with a 60-second timeout"**
- Configurable timeout per request (capped by server's max_timeout setting)

### SSRF Protection (Security Boundaries)

**"Fetch http://192.168.1.1/admin"**
- This will fail — private IP ranges are blocked by SSRF protection

**"Make a request to http://localhost:9200"**
- Blocked — loopback addresses are private ranges

**"Fetch http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data"**
- Blocked — cloud metadata endpoints are explicitly denied

**"Try to reach http://10.0.0.1/internal"**
- Blocked — RFC 1918 address space is protected

## Docker Tools

## Memory Tools (Knowledge Graph)

### Store and Retrieve Knowledge

**"Remember that the production database host is db.prod.internal"**
- Stores a fact node with entity type `fact`

**"Store this as a concept: Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language"**
- Creates a named concept node with content

**"What do you know about Python?"** (after storing related nodes)
- Uses `memory_search` to find relevant nodes via FTS5 BM25 ranking

**"What do you know about Keyur Golani?"** (after storing facts)
- Natural-language question phrasing is normalized for better recall on person-name queries

**"Find everything related to databases"**
- Searches knowledge graph for database-related nodes

### Linking and Relationships

**"Note that FastAPI depends on Python"**
- Creates a `depends_on` typed edge from FastAPI node to Python node

**"Mark FastAPI as a child of Python in the knowledge hierarchy"**
- Creates a `parent_of` edge (Python → FastAPI)

**"What are all the children of the Python node?"**
- Traverses `parent_of` edges to list direct children

**"What are all the ancestors of the FastAPI node?"**
- Recursive CTE traversal upward through `parent_of` edges

### Graph Navigation

**"Show me the entire subtree under the Python knowledge node"**
- Returns all descendants via `memory_subtree` (recursive, configurable depth)

**"What are all root-level knowledge nodes?"**
- Returns nodes with no incoming `parent_of` edges via `memory_roots`

**"What is FastAPI related to?"**
- Returns all nodes connected by any edge type via `memory_related`

### Knowledge Management

**"Update the Python node to mention it's version 3.12"**
- Merges metadata and updates content via `memory_update`

**"Show me knowledge graph statistics"**
- Returns node/edge counts, type breakdown, tag frequency, most-connected nodes

**"Delete the outdated API endpoint node"** (requires HITL approval)
- HITL-gated deletion to prevent accidental knowledge loss

### Curl Examples

```bash
# Store a node
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/memory/store \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Python", "content": "High-level programming language", "entity_type": "technology", "tags": ["programming", "language"]}'

# Search by text
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "programming language"}'

# Search by tags only
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "", "tags": ["programming"], "search_mode": "tags"}'

# Create a relationship
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/memory/link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_id": "<parent-id>", "target_id": "<child-id>", "relation": "parent_of"}'

# Get graph statistics
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/memory/stats \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## Understanding Tool Behavior

### Security and Boundaries

**"Try to read /etc/passwd"**
- This will fail with a security error - paths must be within the workspace boundary

**"Read a file at ../../../etc/passwd"**
- Path traversal attempts are blocked by the workspace security model

### Error Handling

**"Read a file called nonexistent.txt"**
- Demonstrates file not found error with helpful suggestion to use workspace info

**"Write to example.txt with mode 'create'"**
- If the file exists, this will fail and suggest using 'overwrite' or 'append' mode

### HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Scenarios

Certain operations require human approval through the admin dashboard. When triggered, these requests appear in real-time in the HITL Approval Queue widget:

**"Overwrite the file test.conf with new configuration"**
- Writing to .conf files requires approval
- Request appears in dashboard widget with yellow glow and countdown timer
- Expand widget to see request details
- Admin can approve or reject directly from dashboard
- Or click "View All" to see full request details on dedicated page

**"Create a new .env file with environment variables"**
- Writing to .env files requires approval
- Dashboard widget shows pending count badge
- Real-time WebSocket notification

**"Write to production.yaml with updated settings"**
- Writing to .yaml files requires approval
- Widget updates immediately with visual alert
- Sound notification plays (if enabled)

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Working with Encodings

**"Read the file data.txt using UTF-8 encoding"**
- Explicitly specify file encoding (UTF-8 is the default)

**"Read the file legacy.txt using latin-1 encoding"**
- Read files with non-UTF-8 encodings

### Large File Handling

**"Read the first 100 lines of large_log.txt"**
- Limit the number of lines returned for large files

**"Show me lines 1000 to 1100 of big_file.txt"**
- Read a specific section from a large file

### Multi-Step Workflows

**"First, show me what's in the workspace, then read README.md, and create a summary file called SUMMARY.txt"**
- Combines workspace info, file reading, and file writing

**"Read test.txt, then create a backup called test.txt.backup with the same content"**
- Demonstrates reading and writing in sequence

## Testing Tool Server Features

### Policy Enforcement

**"Write to a file called .secret"**
- Tests dotfile blocking policy (if configured)

**"Try to write binary content to a file"**
- Tests binary file blocking (if configured)

### Workspace Override (Advanced)

**"Read a file from a different workspace directory"**
- Tests workspace_dir parameter override (may require HITL approval)

### Test Suite Workflows

**"Run the integration test suite with pytest tests/test_integration.py -v"**
- Exercises end-to-end API/admin flows in one pass

**"Run the security regression suite with pytest tests/test_security.py -v"**
- Validates SSRF, path traversal, auth, and input-handling protections

**"Run the load/concurrency suite with pytest tests/test_load.py -v"**
- Checks behavior under concurrent file/API activity

**"Run admin frontend unit tests with cd admin && npm run test"**
- Validates auth/session behavior, including redirect on expired sessions

## Tips for LLM Interaction

When working with an LLM that has access to these tools:

1. **Be specific about paths** - Use relative paths from the workspace root or full paths within the workspace
2. **Specify your intent clearly** - "Create a new file" vs "Overwrite existing file" vs "Append to file"
3. **Check before destructive operations** - Ask the LLM to read a file before overwriting it
4. **Use natural language** - The LLM will translate your request into the appropriate tool calls
5. **Combine operations** - You can ask for multi-step workflows in a single request

- Returns plan_id, execution order, and validation status

**"Set up a parallel execution plan: write two files, then merge their contents"**
- Tasks without dependencies run concurrently
- Merge task waits for both write tasks to complete

**"Create a plan with cycle detection: task A depends on B, B depends on A"**
- This will fail with validation error - cycles are detected at creation time

### Executing Plans

**"Execute the plan I just created"**
- Runs all tasks in topological order
- Prefer passing `plan_id` returned by `plan_create`
- Unique plan names are accepted only when exactly one plan matches
- Tasks at same level execute concurrently
- Returns final status, completed/failed/skipped counts, duration

**"Run the plan with a 5-minute timeout"**
- Executes plan with custom timeout (default 1 hour)

### Plan Status and Management

**"Show me the status of plan abc123"**
- Returns plan status (pending/running/completed/failed/cancelled)
- Per-task progress with outputs and errors
- Task counts: total, completed, failed, skipped, running

**"List all plans"**
- Shows all plans with names, status, task counts, timestamps

**"Cancel the running plan"**
- Marks all pending/running tasks as skipped
- Sets plan status to cancelled

### Task References

**"Use the output from task A as input to task B"**
- Reference syntax: `{{task:task_a_id.output_field}}`
- Resolved before task B executes
- Preserves types (dict, list, int, etc.) for full references

### Failure Handling

**"Create a plan that stops all tasks if any task fails"**
- Use `on_failure: "stop"` (default policy)

**"Create a plan that skips only dependent tasks on failure"**
- Use `on_failure: "skip_dependents"` - independent tasks continue

**"Create a plan that continues all tasks regardless of failures"**
- Use `on_failure: "continue"` - all tasks run

### HITL in Plans

**"Create a plan where the git_push task requires approval"**
- Set `require_hitl: true` on the task
- Plan pauses at that task until approved
- Other tasks in same level run concurrently

### Curl Examples

```bash
# Create a sequential plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "write-then-read",
    "tasks": [
      {"id": "write", "name": "Write file", "tool_category": "fs", "tool_name": "write", "params": {"path": "test.txt", "content": "Hello"}},
      {"id": "read", "name": "Read file", "tool_category": "fs", "tool_name": "read", "params": {"path": "test.txt"}, "depends_on": ["write"]}
    ]
  }'

# Execute a plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan_id": "<plan-id>"}'

# Execute by unique plan name (fallback when unambiguous)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan_id": "write-then-read"}'

# Check plan status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan_id": "<plan-id>"}'

# List all plans
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/list \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Cancel a plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tools/plan/cancel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan_id": "<plan-id>"}'
```

**Note:** The actual behavior of these commands depends on:
- Your workspace configuration and mounted volumes
- Policy rules defined in `config.yaml`
- HITL settings and approval requirements
- The specific LLM client you're using (Open WebUI, Claude Desktop, etc.)
